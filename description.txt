Once upon a time, in a post-surgery pain medication haze, I made one hundred and one pots, only to realize once all of them were donw that I had accidentally made them at twice as big as they were supposed to be. Rather than scrap them all, I decided to split them off to a separate mod, so that people who don't mind the higher resolution can still have them if they want.

There's 6 sets of pots of various sizes based on the pottery of various cultures around the world. They are made using a pottery wheel made 10 wood, an iron bar and some clay. The sets are:
- Porcelain (silver dye)
- Savannah (grass seeds)
- Jungle (jungle grass seeds)
- Forest (wood)
- Mediterranean (smooth marble)
- Desert (sand)

I'm not currently planning to add more to this, but I'll keep it up-to-date, and if anyone has requests the pot madness may return. They were *very* fun to do. :P
