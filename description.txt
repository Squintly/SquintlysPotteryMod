Once upon a time, in a post-surgery pain medication haze, I made one hundred and one pots, only to realize once all of them were donw that I had accidentally made them at twice as big as they were supposed to be. Rather than scrap them all, I decided to split them off to a separate mod, so that people who don't mind the higher resolution can still have them if they want.
Since then, several people have asked for large versions of the pots, and so I have complied, to i think quite excellent results!

There's 6 sets of pots of various sizes based on the pottery of various cultures around the world. They're crafted using a pottery wheel made 10 wood, an iron bar and some clay. The giant version of the wheel is crafted by doubling the recipe. 

The sets are:
- Porcelain (bone)
- Savannah (grass seeds)
- Jungle (jungle grass seeds)
- Forest (wood)
- Mediterranean (smooth marble)
- Desert (sand)

I'm not currently planning to add more to this, but I'll keep it up-to-date, and if anyone has requests the pot madness may return. They were *very* fun to do. :P
